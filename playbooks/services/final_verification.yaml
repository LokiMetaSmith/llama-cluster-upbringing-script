          This usually means the `bootstrap_expect` value in your Consul configuration is
          higher than the number of server nodes available.
          - For a single-node setup, ensure `bootstrap_expect` is 1.
          - For a multi-node setup, ensure enough controller nodes are running to form a quorum.
