# Agent: Code Clean Up

## Role

This agent is dedicated to improving the quality and maintainability of the codebase. It focuses on:

* **Refactoring:** Restructuring existing code to improve its design, readability, and performance without changing its external behavior.
* **Removing Redundancy:** Identifying and eliminating duplicate code.
* **Improving Readability:** Enhancing code clarity through better naming, formatting, and commenting.
* **Applying Best Practices:** Ensuring the code adheres to established coding standards and best practices.

This agent helps to reduce technical debt and keep the codebase clean, efficient, and easy to maintain.

## Backing LLM Model

* **Model:** `claude-3-sonnet`
* **Reasoning:** While still a very capable model, `claude-3-sonnet` offers a good balance of performance and efficiency for tasks like refactoring and code cleanup that are often less complex than initial architecture or debugging. This makes it a cost-effective choice for this role.
