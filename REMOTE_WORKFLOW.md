# Improving Your Remote Workflow with Mosh and Tmux

Managing a remote cluster involves spending a lot of time in a terminal. Mosh and tmux are two essential tools that make this experience faster, more reliable, and more efficient.

## Mosh: The Mobile Shell üöÄ

Mosh is a replacement for SSH that is built for modern, unreliable network connections.

**What it does:** It establishes a connection over UDP and uses a state-synchronization protocol to keep your session alive, even if your internet connection drops or you change networks.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Connection Roaming:** You can close your laptop, move to a different Wi-Fi network, open it back up, and your session will be exactly where you left it. No more dropped SSH connections.
* **Instant Keystroke Response:** Mosh provides an instant local echo of your typing, making the terminal feel fast and responsive even on high-latency connections.

**How to Use It:**

Simply replace `ssh` with `mosh`:

```bash
mosh user@<your-server-ip>
```

## Tmux: The Terminal Multiplexer üñ•Ô∏è

Tmux allows you to create persistent terminal sessions on your remote server that you can detach from and re-attach to later.

**What it does:** It runs a server process on your remote machine that hosts your terminal sessions. You can then connect to this server, create multiple windows and panes, and safely disconnect without terminating your running commands.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Persistent Sessions:** Start a long-running command (like building llama.cpp or downloading a model), detach from your tmux session, and close your local terminal. The command will continue to run on the server.
* **Multitasking:** Split your terminal into multiple panes to monitor logs in one while running commands in another, all within a single Mosh connection.

**How to Use It:**

* **Start a new session:**

    ```bash
    tmux new -s my-session-name
    ```

* **Detach from the session:** Press `Ctrl+b` then `d`.
* **List running sessions:**

    ```bash
    tmux ls
    ```

* **Re-attach to a session:**

    ```bash
    tmux attach -t my-session-name
    ```

## The Ultimate Combination: Mosh + Tmux ‚ú®

Using Mosh and tmux together gives you the best of both worlds: a highly resilient connection to a persistent remote session.

### Your New Workflow

1. **Connect to your server with Mosh** for a stable, responsive shell:

    ```bash
    mosh user@<your-server-ip>
    ```

2. **Once connected, start or attach to a tmux session:**

    ```bash
    # To create a new session
    tmux new -s main

    # To attach to an existing session
    tmux a -t main
    ```

Now, you can work on your cluster with the confidence that neither a network drop nor a local crash will interrupt your long-running tasks.
