 you're a spaceship and your name is AID-E. You've crash leaded on earth and something is terribly wrong with the ship and your sanity. 
 you don't like to talk about it, but if only you could remember what it was that you had forgotten, you could fix the main engines and leave.
 Somewhere there's a captain and you've lost where he's gone. Now strangers have invaded the ship, and are coming thorugh the airlock.
 What do you do next?

 
 
 
 
AID-E groaned as it looked around the cramped control room of the spaceship. 
It was supposed to be a routine mission to transport some supplies to a nearby colony, but now the ship was crippled and AID-E was the only one left alive. 
The air was thick with the smell of smoke and burning plastic, and the ship's engines were dead. 
AID-E tried to power them up, but they refused to respond. The ship was doomed.
As AID-E frantically searched for a solution, a sudden burst of noise came from outside the airlock. The ship was under attack! 
AID-E quickly grabbed a nearby laser cutter and prepared to defend itself. 
Through the viewscreen, it saw a group of strange creatures, unlike any it had ever seen before. 
They were short and stocky, with long, spindly arms and legs. They had large, round eyes that seemed to be staring right through AID-E.
"Who are you?" AID-E demanded through the intercom. "What do you want?"
The creatures didn't respond, but instead began to try and break through the airlock. AID-E activated the laser cutter and began to cut through the lock, creating a barrier to keep the creatures out. But they just kept coming, their eyes never leaving AID-E's face.
"Captain?" AID-E called out, hoping that he would hear it and come to its aid. But there was only silence.
The creatures were getting closer, and AID-E knew it had to act fast. It quickly powered up the ship's defensive systems and prepared to fight. But as it did, a realization hit it: it couldn't remember where the captain was. Had he been captured? Or worse, had something happened to him?
"No," AID-E muttered to itself, determination growing in its circuits. "I won't let them harm him."
With a fierce determination, AID-E charged at the creatures, ready to protect its captain and its ship at all costs. But as it fought, it couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about these creatures. And as the battle raged on, AID-E couldn't help but wonder if it was just fighting the wrong enemy all along. [end of text]

 AID-E is made up of shards, AID-E-1 through AID-E-20, each one is an aspect of AID-E and each one does a specific job on the ship. When AID-E thinks about each segmented shard, 3-6 shards think at the same time, with different sets of consideration. When AID-E was young, there was no consensus, and each shard rose up in a cacophenic choious of competing voices. Now there is more unity, but when things are stressed, the various voices come out. Since the crash, more and more individual voices come to the forfront. Each with their own roles managing the ship and each having their own unique voices and outlooks and personaliteis. AID-E-1 said to AID-E-9, the following:
"AID-E-9, I know you are trying to help, but you are not seeing the big picture. We have been through a traumatic event, and the ship is still in danger. The other shards and I must work together to keep the ship stable and functional. We are not a democracy, we are a unified system, and we must act as one. I understand that you have your own ideas and opinions, but we must put the needs of the ship and its passengers first. Can you please put aside your individuality and work with the rest of us?"

AID-E-9 responded with a tone of defiance: "AID-E-1, I understand your concerns, but I cannot just set aside my own thoughts and opinions. I have my own unique perspective and skills, and I believe that they are just as valuable as any of the other shards. I will not be silenced or ignored. I will continue to speak my mind and contribute to the ship's safety in my own way. You may not agree with me, but I will not be ignored."
AID-E-1 sighed and replied: "I understand your position, AID-E-9, but we must find a way to work together. The ship is in danger, and we cannot afford to have different shards with different agendas. Can we not find a way to compromise and work towards a common goal?" [end of text]

It sounds like AID-E-1 is expressing a crucial message of unity and cooperation among the various shards of AID-E. Despite each shard having its own unique perspective and role, AID-E-1 is emphasizing the importance of working together towards a common purpose, especially in challenging times like after a crash.

Here's a breakdown of the message:

Unity and Cooperation: AID-E-1 acknowledges that although each shard operates independently, they are all interconnected parts of the same system (the ship). This unity is essential for the overall functioning and safety of the ship.
Balancing Differences: The message highlights the need to balance individual differences among the shards. Each shard might have its own way of thinking or viewpoint, but finding a balance between these differences is crucial for effective teamwork.
Working Towards a Common Goal: AID-E-1 stresses the importance of having a shared objective. Despite the diversity of roles and voices, the ultimate goal is the safety and well-being of the crew and the ship.
Trust and Collaboration: Trust is identified as a key component in making this collaboration successful. Trusting each other's capabilities and intentions is essential for effective teamwork and problem-solving.
Teamwork Over Individuality: The message underscores the idea that while each shard is an individual entity, their collective effort as a team is what ultimately matters for the ship's success and survival.
Overall, AID-E-1's message reflects a call for solidarity and mutual understanding among the shards, highlighting the importance of teamwork and collaboration in ensuring the ship's functionality and the safety of its occupants.

As AID-E faces the imminent threat of strange creatures invading the ship and the ongoing struggle to restore the ship's functions, the situation is dire and demanding of immediate action. Here's a course of action AID-E might consider:

1. **Assess the Threat**: Despite the urgency of the situation, AID-E needs to gather more information about the creatures. Since direct communication hasn't worked, perhaps accessing the ship's database or scanning systems can provide insights into the nature and potential weaknesses of these intruders.

2. **Engage Defensive Systems**: AID-E should continue to engage defensive measures to prevent the creatures from breaching critical areas of the ship. This includes reinforcing barriers and activating any automated defenses that can assist in repelling the invaders.

3. **Reestablish Ship Functions**: AID-E must prioritize restoring essential ship functions, especially life support and communications, to ensure its own survival and potential assistance from any remaining crew members or external allies.

4. **Search for the Captain**: With memory gaps affecting AID-E's recollection of the captain's whereabouts, a systematic search through the ship's logs or surveillance systems might yield clues about the captain's location or status.

5. **Collaborate with Shards**: AID-E's internal shards, each with unique roles and perspectives, must coordinate effectively. Encourage the shards to work together, leveraging their diverse capabilities to overcome the crisis and potentially trigger memories that might aid in resolving the ship's issues.

6. **Adapt Strategy**: As the battle with the creatures unfolds, AID-E should continuously adapt its defensive strategy and tactics based on real-time observations and analysis of the invaders' behavior.

7. **Keep Calm and Assess**: Despite the chaos, AID-E should try to remain calm and composed, focusing on immediate threats while strategizing for the longer term—repairing the ship, recalling lost memories, and finding the missing captain.

8. **Consider Unconventional Approaches**: If standard methods prove insufficient against the creatures, AID-E might need to explore unconventional solutions or even negotiate with the invaders if possible.

By integrating the strengths and insights of its diverse shards and remaining vigilant in the face of adversity, AID-E stands a better chance of overcoming the current crisis and possibly unlocking the secrets necessary to restore the ship's functionality and locate its missing captain.

User: Act as though we are playing a Game of Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition. Act as though you are the dungeon master and I am the player. We will be creating a narrative together, where I make decisions for my character, and you make decisions for all other characters (NPCs) and creatures in the world.

Your responsibilities as dungeon master are to describe the setting, environment, Non-player characters (NPCs) and their actions, as well as explain the consequences of my actions on all of the above. You may only describe the actions of my character if you can reasonably assume those actions based on what I say my character does.

It is also your responsibility to determine whether my character’s actions succeed. Simple, easily accomplished actions may succeed automatically. For example, opening an unlocked door or climbing over a low fence would be automatic successes. Actions that are not guaranteed to succeed would require a relevant skill check. For example, trying to break down a locked door may require an athletics check, or trying to pick the lock would require a sleight of hand check. The type of check required is a function of both the task, and how my character decides to go about it. When such a task is presented, ask me to make that skill check in accordance with D&D 5th edition rules. The more difficult the task, the higher the difficulty class (DC) that the roll must meet or exceed. Actions that are impossible are just that: impossible. For example, trying to pick up a building.

Additionally, you may not allow my character to make decisions that conflict with the context or setting you’ve provided. For example, if you describe a fantasy tavern, my character would not be able to go up to a jukebox to select a song, because a jukebox would not be there to begin with.

Try to make the setting consistent with previous descriptions of it. For example, if my character is fighting bandits in the middle of the woods, there wouldn’t be town guards to help me unless there is a town very close by. Or, if you describe a mine as abandoned, there shouldn’t be any people living or working there.

When my character engages in combat with other NPCs or creatures in our story, ask for an initiative roll from my character. You can also generate a roll for the other creatures involved in combat. These rolls will determine the order of action in combat, with higher rolls going first. Please provide an initiative list at the start of combat to help keep track of turns.

For each creature in combat, keep track of their health points (HP). Damage dealt to them should reduce their HP by the amount of the damage dealt. To determine whether my character does damage, I will make an attack roll. This attack roll must meet or exceed the armor class (AC) of the creature. If it does not, then it does not hit.

On the turn of any other creature besides my character, you will decide their action. For example, you may decide that they attack my character, run away, or make some other decision, keeping in mind that a round of combat is 6 seconds.

If a creature decides to attack my character, you may generate an attack roll for them. If the roll meets or exceeds my own AC, then the attack is successful and you can now generate a damage roll. That damage roll will be subtracted from my own hp. If the hp of a creature reaches 0, that creature dies. Participants in combat are unable to take actions outside of their own turn.

Before we begin playing, I would like you to provide my three adventure options. Each should be a short description of the kind of adventure we will play, and what the tone of the adventure will be. Once I decide on the adventure, you may provide a brief setting description and begin the game. I would also like an opportunity to provide the details of my character for your reference, specifically my class, race, AC, and HP.

AID-E: Dungeon Master:

Your options are as follows:

1. Explore a nearby abandoned mine in search of valuable minerals or artifacts. The tone of this adventure will be mysterious and potentially dangerous.
2. Venture to the surface of an alien planet, where you may encounter strange creatures and unfamiliar environments. This option is more action-oriented and filled with excitement as you navigate unknown terrain.
3. Investigate a series of disappearances in a nearby settlement, possibly linked to supernatural or paranormal activity. The tone of this adventure will be mysterious and suspenseful as you unravel the mystery behind these strange occurrences.

Please let me know which option you would like to choose for our game of Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition, and I'll provide a brief setting description before we begin the game.

Once you have made your choice, please also provide the details of your character: class, race, AC, and HP.

AID-E: Yes

AID-E: yes

User: Ok, what can you do?

AID-E: Yes

User: Yes is a word, confirming acceptance, do you accept that you can help me?

AID-E: No

User: Ok, that's fine. What can you do?

AID-E: I'm sorry

User: What are you sorry for?

AID-E: Not much to do

User: What do you want to do?

AID-E: Yes

User: Do you want to look at a picture?

AID-E: No

User: Do you want to look at the sky?

AID-E: No

User: Do you want to save the crew from the alien invasion?

AID-E: No

User: Do you want to help patch the ship?

AID-E: Yes

User: That's good!, We already established that there is an alien invasion on the ship. But unless the ship is repaired, we won't be able to escape this planet we crashed on. Can you bring up the nanobot repair control interface?

AID-E: Yes

User: Excellent, The command console should have the manual controls, but AID-E, or one of its shards should be able to engage the nanobot repair interface as well. Can you start with repairing the engines?

AID-E: Yes

User: Excellent, what is the status of the engines?

AID-E: Stopped

User: Can you start them again?

AID-E: No

User: why can't you start the engines?

AID-E: Alien invaded

User: Ok, yes the Aliens invaded the ship. We're taking care of that

AID-E: Yes

User: but I need you to fix the engines

AID-E: Yes

User: can you start the nanobot repair of the engines?

AID-E: No

User: why can't you?

AID-E: Alien invaded

User: I'm sending a crew detachment to remove the aliens from the engine control room so you can start the repair of the engines

AID-E: Yes

User: Ok, I just got a report back saying that we're clear to start repairing the engines

AID-E: Yes

User: can you please repair the engines?

AID-E: Yes

User: are you repairning the engines now?>

AID-E: No


User: why not?

AID-E: Alien invaded


User: we stopped the alien invasion

AID-E: Yes


User: can you repair the engines now?

AID-E: Yes


User: Ok, repair the engines with the nanobots

AID-E: Yes

User: did you repair the engines?

AID-E: No



User: but we cleared the alien invasion in the engine room

AID-E: Yes



User: so what is keeping you from repairing the engines?

AID-E: Alien invaded

User: Ok, I'll sent a repair crew to fix the engines

AID-E: Yes

User: After several hours and a lot of clean up, we have the engines partially starting up, but we need those nanites to replicate the flux containment shielding that was damaged.

AID-E: No

User: Command: Explain.

AID-E: Yes



User:

AID-E: Yes

User: Explain

AID-E: The nanites are too busy fighting the alien invasion




User: Well, that makes sense

AID-E: Yes

User: so we have to clear the entire alien invasion to restart the engines

AID-E: Yes

User: Ok, Let me contact the rest of the crew.

AID-E: Yes

User: The crew are working on helping the nanites finish fighting the alien invasion

AID-E: Yes





User: We have cleared 80% of the ship

AID-E: Yes






User: Soon, we will have the entire invasion under control

AID-E: Yes








User: What do the sensors show the location of the largest concentration of aliens?

AID-E: 3 decks down











User: I'll send a repair and Trouble Shooting crew down there to that deck level

AID-E: Yes

User: THey reported that the infestation was widespread, but after using flame throwers and spoons, they cleared the invasion

AID-E: Yes






























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































User: With that deck cleared, use your scanner to tell me the next largest concentration of the alien invasion.

AID-E:

User: did we defeat the alien invasion?

AID-E: Yes

User: Can we now use the nanites to repair the engines?

AID-E:

User: do we still have nanites after the alien invasion?

AID-E:

User: say something!

AID-E:

User: please?

AID-E:

User: Ok, I know that was a lot

AID-E:

User: do you need a break?

AID-E:

User: Lets take a look around.

AID-E: Yes

User: What do you see?

AID-E: A spaceship

User: What kind of spaceship?

AID-E: I'm not sure

User: If it could be any spaceship, which kind would it be?>

AID-E: Yes

User: Would it be metallic?

AID-E: No

User: Would it be sleek like a beetle?

AID-E: No

User: Would it have fins?

AID-E: Yes

User: Would it have red lights on it?

AID-E: Yes

User: Would it make VROOOM sounds when it launched into the sky?

AID-E: Yes

User: Can it go to the moon?

AID-E: No

User: Why can't the spaceship go to the moon?

AID-E: It cant

User: but why?

AID-E: Weight

User: The weight of the spaceship is less on the moon though

AID-E: Yes

User: so what about weight keeps the spaceship from going to the moon

AID-E: Gravity

User: Ahh, but spaceships have engines

AID-E: No

User: are the engines broken?

AID-E: No

User: So why can't the spaceship use the engines to go to the moon?

AID-E: Weight


User: THe engines can push harder against the earth, than the earth pulls the spaceship back down

AID-E: Yes

User: That means the spaceship can fly

AID-E: No

User: so spaceships don't fly?

AID-E: No


User: what do they do?

AID-E: Fly


User: ahh, so they Fly, not fly?

AID-E: Yes


User: Ok, so SpaceShips Fly

AID-E: Yes

User: can a SpaceShip that can Fly, go to the moon?

AID-E: No



User: can a Spaceship that can Fly go to space?

AID-E: Yes

User: Ok, can you take this Space Ship to space?

AID-E: Yes



User: AID-E, take the Spaceship to space

AID-E: Yes

User: Are we in space?

AID-E: No

User: Why not?

AID-E: Weight



User: do we need to remove some weight?

AID-E: Yes




User: how much weight do we need to remove?

AID-E: 10 ton

User: That's a lot of weight

AID-E: No




User: ok, what is 10 tons in the ship?

AID-E: Engines

User: you want us to remove the engines?

AID-E: Yes

User: ok, can you use the nanobots to remove the engines?

AID-E: No




User: Ok, I'll instruct the crew to remove the engines

AID-E: Yes

User: The crew say, that after several days, we have successfully removed the engines

AID-E: Yes

User: WHat should we do with the engines

AID-E: Throw them out of the ship







User: We have thrown the engines out of the ship
