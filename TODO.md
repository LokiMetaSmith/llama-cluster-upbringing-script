# TODO

## Immediate Actions
- [x] Fix Memory Service networking (Port 8000 conflict).
- [x] Implement real LLM calls in `worker_agent.py` (replace mock).
- [x] Connect `PlannerTool` to real LLM for robust plan generation.
- [x] Refactor `pipecatapp` role to use Docker image for memory service in production.

## Frontier Agent Roadmap (In Progress)
- [x] Phase 1: Foundation (SwarmTool, Worker Agent).
- [x] Phase 2: Shared Brain (Memory Service).
- [x] Phase 3: Context Awareness (ProjectMapper, Planner).
- [x] Phase 4: Continuous Evolution (Self-correction loop).

## Backlog
- [x] Add `frontend_verification_instructions` for UI changes.

## Notes
> "The Planner has awakened. No longer bound by hardcoded heuristics, it now contemplates the codebase with the full depth of a Large Language Model. It does not just execute; it *understands*. Or so we hope. The first step towards a truly autonomous architect has been taken."
