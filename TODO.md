# TODO - Implement SEAL-Inspired Self-Adaptation Loop

This file tracks the implementation of a new self-adapting capability inspired by the SEAL paper. The goal is to create a closed loop where the system can reflect on its own failures and trigger a prompt evolution process to autonomously improve its core agent prompts.

## Key Components:

-   [ ] **ADAPTATION_AGENT.md**: A new agent definition file to formally describe the self-improvement agent's role.
-   [ ] **adaptation_manager.py**: A new script to orchestrate the adaptation process, generating test cases from failures.
-   [ ] **supervisor.py modifications**: Integrate the `adaptation_manager.py` into the main system loop.
-   [ ] **evolve.py modifications**: Update the prompt evolution script to accept dynamically generated test cases.
-   [ ] **Documentation Updates**: Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect the new capabilities.

## Task Breakdown:

1.  [X] **Create `TODO.md`**: Initialize this tracking document.
2.  [ ] **Define `ADAPTATION_AGENT.md`**: Create the markdown file in `prompt_engineering/agents/`.
3.  [ ] **Develop `adaptation_manager.py`**:
    -   [ ] Stub out the main function and argument parsing.
    -   [ ] Implement logic to receive failure data.
    -   [ ] Implement logic to generate a YAML test case file from the failure data.
    -   [ ] Implement logic to call the `evolve.py` script with the new test case.
4.  [ ] **Modify `supervisor.py`**:
    -   [ ] Add a call to `adaptation_manager.py` when `reflect.py` returns an `error` action.
5.  [ ] **Modify `evolve.py`**:
    -   [ ] Add argument parsing for an external test case file.
    -   [ ] Update the test case loading logic to use the provided file if available.
6.  [ ] **Update `ARCHITECTURE.md`**:
    -   [ ] Add a new section describing the "Self-Adaptation Loop".
    -   [ ] Include the `ADAPTATION_AGENT.md` in the agent hierarchy.
7.  [ ] **Final Review and Testing**:
    -   [ ] Manually trigger a failure to test the end-to-end loop.
    -   [ ] Review all new code and documentation for clarity and correctness.
