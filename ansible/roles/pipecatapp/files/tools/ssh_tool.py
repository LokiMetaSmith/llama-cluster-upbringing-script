    """A tool for executing commands on a remote machine via SSH.

    This class wraps the `paramiko` library to provide a simple interface for
    the agent to connect to other machines and run commands. It supports both
    key-based and password-based authentication.

    Attributes:
        description (str): A brief description of the tool's purpose.
        name (str): The name of the tool.

        It is highly recommended to use key-based authentication for security.

            host (str): The hostname or IP address of the remote machine.
            username (str): The username to connect with.
            command (str): The command to execute on the remote machine.
            key_filename (str, optional): The path to the private SSH key file.
                Defaults to None.
            password (str, optional): The password for authentication.
                Defaults to None.

        Returns:
            str: The standard output from the command, or an error message if
                 the command fails or an exception occurs.
