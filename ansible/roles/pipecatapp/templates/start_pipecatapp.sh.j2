# Wrapper Script for pipecatapp
#
# This script ensures that the pipecat application is run within its
# virtual environment and that all of its output (both stdout and stderr)
# is reliably redirected to a log file for debugging.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e

# Define the log file path
LOG_FILE="/tmp/pipecat.log"

# *** FIX: Change to the application directory first ***
cd /opt/pipecatapp

# Activate the virtual environment
source /home/{{ target_user }}/.local/bin/activate

# Create the log file if it doesn't exist
touch "$LOG_FILE"

# Execute the Python application, redirecting all output to the log file.
# The 'exec' command replaces the shell process with the python process.
echo "--- Starting pipecat-app: $(date) ---" >> "$LOG_FILE"
exec /home/{{ target_user }}/.local/bin/python3 /opt/pipecatapp/app.py >> "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1
