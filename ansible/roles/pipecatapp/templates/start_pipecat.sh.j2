# Wrapper Script for pipecat-app
#
# This script ensures that the pipecat application is run within its
# virtual environment and that all of its output (both stdout and stderr)
# is reliably redirected to a log file for debugging.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e

# Define the log file path
LOG_FILE="{{ pipecat_log_file }}"

# Activate the virtual environment
source {{ pipecat_app_dir }}/venv/bin/activate

# Create the log file if it doesn't exist
touch "$LOG_FILE"

# Execute the Python application, redirecting all output to the log file.
# The 'exec' command replaces the shell process with the python process.
